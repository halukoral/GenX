# GenX
 A simple application framework designed to be used with Vulkan. Windows only.

 Based on [Walnut](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut.git) and [LittleVulkanEngine](https://github.com/blurrypiano/littleVulkanEngine).
 
 Since I am developing this project for learning purposes, you may find errors whether in CMake or in the codes. I would appreciate if you keep me informed about these errors, if any.

 With this framework, I aim to save you a lot of work when you start learning Vulkan. It allows you to focus on Vulkan development without wasting time on drudgery.

 If there is something you want me to add to the framework, do not hesitate to contact me. 
 
## Usage
```cpp
 mkdir Build
 cd Build
 cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```
